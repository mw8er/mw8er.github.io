As of today, I switched from Jekyll to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

The layout was inspired by [Alex Crooks](https://alexcrooks.me/) and the implementation was inspired by both [SvelteKit Documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) and [SvelteKit Blog Demo](https://svelteland.github.io/svelte-kit-blog-demo/).
